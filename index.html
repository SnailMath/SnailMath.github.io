			hollyhock-2 is a program loader for the classpad II aka fx-cp400 which enables you to run programs written in assembly and c on your classpad II.
		</h2>
		<p>
			In 2020, I found an 
			<a href="https://the6p4c.github.io/2018/01/15/hacking-the-gc-part-1.html">article by The6P4C</a>
			where they modified the firmware of the Casio Classpad II aka fx-cp 400, 
			so they could run their own programs like games on the calculator. 
			I had to find out how they did it, so I wrote my own launcher, the LOADER IIb, and made the first youtube video about it (see below).
		</p>
		<p>
			After the video was pubished, I found many other people, who wanted to play games and program for the calculator, so we started the inofficial Classpad 
			<a href="https://discord.com/invite/y8Mr8tD"> Discord Server</a>.
			With so many people interested in the calculator, we quickly found the original 
			<a href="https://github.com/Stellaris-code/hollyhock-fork">hollyhock</a>
			launcher by The6P4C, so we immediately abandoned my simple LOADER IIb and continiued work on hollyhock, making it 
			<a href="https://github.com/SnailMath/hollyhock-2">hollyhock-2</a>, 
			so we have all the same foundation for all our games and programs.
		</p>
		<p>
			(The only difference between hollyhock and hollyhock-2 is that hollyhock-2 is much easier to insatll, it preserves the exam mode and it adds a simple

			and the ability to
